When a player connects to your proxy server, this plugin sends a ping to your target host (defined in the config file) and waits for a response. If a response comes back, it is assumed that your minecraft server is online and will do nothing under the assumption that bungeechord will do the rest of the work. If it's offline however, it will send a Wake-on-LAN packet to target host (once again defined in the config file). Works best when you have setup a fallback server (such as a [Limbo server](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/limbo-standalone-server-lightweight-solution-for-afk-or-waiting-rooms-in-your-server-network.82468/)) for your players to wait in.
